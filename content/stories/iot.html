<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your name?</strong></p>
<p>Piotr Zarzycki</p>
<p><strong>Which ApacheCon/Apache event did you attend?</strong></p>
<p>I attended ApacheCon.</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project(s)/Open Source Software project(s) are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>I am involved in the Apache Flex project.</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>I am from Poland (Cracow).</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely one of the best things was meeting people who you know only from
mailing lists.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Chris Dutz - His smile and attitude to me and other people were amazing. He
gathered not only people from the Apache Flex project, but also from other
projects. Thanks to him I met many amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Chris!</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the best was Chris Dutz&rsquo;s talk &ldquo;Building SCADA Systems with
Apache Software&rdquo; - He did his talk with a lot of passion, which not only I
have felt but many other people. That was so strong that I know that his
idea is realistic.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not disappointed in any way related to TAC. People who handled the
program were well prepared. My expectations were more than fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thank you, TAC!</p>
<h2 id="rafael-weingärtner">Rafael Weingärtner <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink" href="#rafael-weing%c3%a4rtner">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your name?</strong></p>
<p>I am Rafael Weingärtner.</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project(s)/Open Source Software project(s) are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Apache CloudStack and IOTA</p>
<p><strong>Were you a student/academic at the time of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I was a Ph.D. student in Computer Science </p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>Brazil</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>The opportunity to meet great people from all around the world. Not just
technical folks, but also people who know how to create and manage huge
projects on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Also Lightning talks; I swear that I am not only saying that
because there were free beers and snacks ;)</p>
<p><strong>What was the best new project you heardabout at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Chronix, a database system based on Lucene and Solr that is optimized for
timeseries. That was
kind of unexpected to see a project like that that can solve some of the problems
I am facing in my Ph. D. It was also interesting to see other scholars
actively participating and engaging in the Apache world. The Chronix was a
nice example; it is mainly developed by a Ph.D. student.</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite non-talk part of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>The event at the Steamworks Brewing Company. Great beer and lots of fun.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Daan Hoogland; this guy is awesome. He is in the Apache
CloudStack PMC, and we have been working together for over 4 years. We
exchange emails weekly, and ApacheCon NA was the opportunity to meet and
share a beer. Daan is not just a great coder and PMC member, but also a
great friend.</p>
<p><strong>What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Apache Fey, which is part of Apache IOTA. This project is what I was
looking for to serve the base for a system that I have been building.</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to someone thinking ofapplying to TAC for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>Go for it ;)  </p>
