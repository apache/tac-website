<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your name?</strong></p>
<p>Ignasi Barrera</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been actively involved in Apache jclouds for about four years, since a
little bit before the project joined the ASF. I am the project&rsquo;s
current Chair, and about 9 months ago I became a Member of the
foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>From sunny Barcelona!</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Discovering that Apache, at its core, and despite being a big
organisation, is like a little family. I was really surprised how open
and welcoming everyone was. I had the opportunity to talk with TAC,
infra, and many people directly involved in the foundation structure,
and I always felt like I was actually part of the same thing. Meeting
the people who make Apache and discovering how open everyone was, was
one of the best things I remember from ApacheCon.</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoyed David Nalley&rsquo;s keynote. There is quite an extended
perception in people around the world, outside the ASF, that Apache
projects are old school projects, often leveraging obsolete
technology. There is a quote I love from Rich Bowen that says, &ldquo;Apache
has a legacy to project, but also a future to invent,&rdquo; (and projects
such as the httpd server or Spark are perfect examples for that) and
David&rsquo;s keynote illustrated that pretty well and demystified that
perception by showing how important for the industry Apache is. Not
only for the technology and solutions their projects bring, but also
for the way they are governed, how the community collaborates to create
them, and how that open and collaborative model is the pillar of their
success and an open source reference.</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first
time?</strong></p>
<p>Just apply. They will find a very friendly environment and an
excellent opportunity to meet, among many others, the people who
make Apache possible.</p>
<p><strong>What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to talk with committers and PMC members of other
projects that are built on top of Apache jclouds. At ApacheCon we had to take some unpopular decisions, such as dropping
support for unmaintained providers, or rejecting some pull requests
that had little hope to progress, and one of the objectives I had was
to directly discuss with the jclouds ecosystem what impact that could
have, how the projects could collaborate better, and how we could
better align our roadmaps.</p>
