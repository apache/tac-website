<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your name?</strong></p>
<p>Keren Ouaknine</p>
<p><strong>Which ApacheCon/Apache event did you attend?</strong></p>
<p>ApacheCon in Miami, FL 2017.</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project(s)/Open Source Software project(s) are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Apache AsterixDB, Apache Pig</p>
<p><strong>Were you a student/academic at the time of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Phd candidate at the Hebrew University.</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>Israel</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>Apply, Apply!</p>
<p>ApacheCon is a unique opportunity to have great discussions with many
open-source-committed people. I was grateful for the privilege to learn
about the Apache community and projects. The total number of sessions and
topics covered in those three conference days was mind-blowing and I can
clearly remember us TAC-ers did not want it to end!</p>
<p><strong>What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Quick anecdote: I volunteered to help with the registration desk on the
first day of the conference along with a friend. Naturally, I familiarized myself
with many of the attenders, their names, workplace/organization. Following
which, I no longer felt like a wandering soul, seeking to find a female peer
to socialize with (as often happens on conferences of this
scale). Instead,
I was part of the TAC-ers: a united, incredibly nice, talented and organized
group. During the registration process, more TAC-ers joined to help with the load
and together we mastered the incoming stream with ease and good spirits!</p>
<p>I cherish the friendship with all the TAC members and organizers and will
keep a very fond memory of this conference.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your name (as you like to be called / shown for the interview)?</strong></p>
<p>Sharan Foga</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Apache OFBiz</p>
<p><strong>Were you a student/academic at the time of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a global traveller. I&rsquo;m originally from the UK but currently
live in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most interesting thing you learned at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>At the Barcamp I learned that everyone in a community is empowered to do
what they think is the best for their project.</p>
<p>This has helped me to begin actively proposing and launching different
initiatives for my project.</p>
<p><strong>What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Apachecon is for anyone involved in a community.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a developer or a technical person, so was initially concerned that I
wouldnt fit in or that everyone would be speaking &ldquo;techspeak&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Instead I found that Apache is like a huge open family and you don&rsquo;t have to
be a techie to be a part of it.</p>
<p>At the time I applied, I was surprised to find out that I was the only
female TAC volunteer - so I would urge women to apply.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?</strong></p>
<p>I expected to arrive at Apachecon and then just be given a list of tasks to
do.</p>
<p>Instead, as well as managing all my travel and accommodation planning, the
TAC team organised a dinner for all the TAC volunteers, so we
could meet and get to know each other informally. This meant that throughout
Apachecon we became a little micro community. This was
demonstrated several times when one of us was not available to do an
allocated task, and someone else would quickly jump  in to cover it.</p>
<p>From the moment you arrive at Apachecon, you are never alone!</p>
<p><strong>What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>During Apachecon myself and other attendees from my project decided to run
an informal brainstorming session. We came up with a lot of
suggestions for mailing list discussion proposals. The result being that our
community has agreed to progress some of these areas.</p>
<p>I think the dynamics of having a face to face meeting improves interaction
on the mailing lists and helps collaboration.</p>
