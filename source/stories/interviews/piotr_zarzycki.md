I am involved in the Apache Flex project.

**What was the best bit about ApacheCon?**

Absolutely one of the best things was meeting people who you know only from
mailing lists.

**Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?**

Chris Dutz - His smile and attitude to me and other people were amazing. He
gathered not only people from the Apache Flex project, but also from other
projects. Thanks to him I met many amazing people.

Thank you so much, Chris!

**What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?**

I think one of the best was Chris Dutz's talk "Building SCADA Systems with
Apache Software" - He did his talk with a lot of passion, which not only I
have felt but many other people. That was so strong that I know that his
idea is realistic.

**How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?**

I'm not disappointed in any way related to TAC. People who handled the
program were well prepared. My expectations were more than fulfilled.

Thank you, TAC!
