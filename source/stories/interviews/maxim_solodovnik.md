**What's your name?**

Maxim Solodovnik

**What Apache project are you involved in?**

OpenMeetings, Flex, Wicket

**Where in the world are you from?**

Russia, Siberia


**What was the best bit about ApacheCon?**

I was able to meet new friends, meet lots of people I was emailing with "in person", I can now wear an "Ask me" badge and easily talk to people I never met before :) 

**Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?**

Melissa, no doubt :) She one of the kindest people at Apache :)

To be serious it is hard to choose _one_ best person. After 4 ApacheCons I can choose many more best persons

**What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?**

I still believe the TomEE talk by David Blevins is the best :) David is a great speaker, and his talk was very technical and full of examples

**What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?**

I was able to improve Apache OpenMeetings a lot after ApacheCons, I got new ideas, new easier ways of implementing things

Hopefully we got new users :)
