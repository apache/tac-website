Great opportunity to meet others on projects from all over the world and put names to faces

**Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?**

Everyone… because everyone is cool. ;-)

**What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?**

Code with beer

**What was your favourite non-talk part of ApacheCon?**

Keynotes and networking

**What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first time?**

Highly recommended. It's a great way to get to these events when funds may be short. 
It's an opportunity.

**What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?**

Meeting with some of the folks and being able to talk about things that may take more time than on the lists.  Being able to exchange ideas before bringing them to the community.  Face to face can have a huge impact on attitude and interaction moving forward, and it's something that can be bestowed to the projects.  Sometimes it's tough to put tone in email, so it's good to share in a personal manner.

**What new things did you get into thanks to ApacheCon?**

I wouldn’t say it got me into anything new, but certainly underscored my feelings about Apache and the value it brings to me and my contributions.  It re-invigorates about why we do the things we do in open source and the impact it has on the world.
