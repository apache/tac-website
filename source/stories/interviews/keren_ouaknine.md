ApacheCon is a unique opportunity to have great discussions with many
open-source-committed people. I was grateful for the privilege to learn
about the Apache community and projects. The total number of sessions and
topics covered in those three conference days was mind-blowing and I can
clearly remember us TAC-ers did not want it to end!

**What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?**

Quick anecdote: I volunteered to help with the registration desk on the
first day of the conference along with a friend. Naturally, I familiarized myself
with many of the attenders, their names, workplace/organization. Following
which, I no longer felt like a wandering soul, seeking to find a female peer
to socialize with (as often happens on conferences of this
scale). Instead,
I was part of the TAC-ers: a united, incredibly nice, talented and organized
group. During the registration process, more TAC-ers joined to help with the load
and together we mastered the incoming stream with ease and good spirits!

I cherish the friendship with all the TAC members and organizers and will
keep a very fond memory of this conference.
