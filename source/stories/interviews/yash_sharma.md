I used to be a newbie contributor to Apache when I started off. Being at Apache con I was more motivated than ever.

I have been learning a lot of new things every day thanks to ApacheCon and my friends in projects @ApacheDrill, @ApacheLens and @ApacheCalcite. Loads of thanks to TAC for this opportunity by virtue of which all of this was possible.
