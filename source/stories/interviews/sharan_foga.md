**What's your name (as you like to be called / shown for the interview)?**

Sharan Foga

**What Apache project are you involved in?**

Apache OFBiz

**Were you a student/academic at the time of ApacheCon?**

No

**Where in the world are you from?**

I'm a bit of a global traveller. I'm originally from the UK but currently
live in the Czech Republic.


**What was the most interesting thing you learned at ApacheCon?**

At the Barcamp I learned that everyone in a community is empowered to do
what they think is the best for their project.

This has helped me to begin actively proposing and launching different
initiatives for my project.

**What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?**

Apachecon is for anyone involved in a community.

I'm not a developer or a technical person, so was initially concerned that I
wouldnt fit in or that everyone would be speaking "techspeak".

Instead I found that Apache is like a huge open family and you don't have to
be a techie to be a part of it.

At the time I applied, I was surprised to find out that I was the only
female TAC volunteer - so I would urge women to apply.

**How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?**

I expected to arrive at Apachecon and then just be given a list of tasks to
do.

Instead, as well as managing all my travel and accommodation planning, the
TAC team organised a dinner for all the TAC volunteers, so we
could meet and get to know each other informally. This meant that throughout
Apachecon we became a little micro community. This was
demonstrated several times when one of us was not available to do an
allocated task, and someone else would quickly jump  in to cover it.

From the moment you arrive at Apachecon, you are never alone!

**What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?**

During Apachecon myself and other attendees from my project decided to run
an informal brainstorming session. We came up with a lot of
suggestions for mailing list discussion proposals. The result being that our
community has agreed to progress some of these areas.

I think the dynamics of having a face to face meeting improves interaction
on the mailing lists and helps collaboration.
