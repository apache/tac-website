### Currently supported events

#### Community Over Code Asia 2023
Applications are now being accepted to attend Community Over Code Asia 2023,
which is taking place in Beijing, China between the 18th and 20th of August.

Event details can be found [on the event website](https://www.bagevent.com/event/8432178).

The ASF Travel Assistance Committee hopes to offer 5 or 6 Conference Passes 
along with Hotel and Travel assistance as needed. Assistance is open to 
anyone involved in Open Source including ASF Committers, non-committer 
contributors and people from open source projects in general.

Places are limited and will be awarded to those that are deemed most in need 
of assistance. In most cases, applicants will be expected to live in Asia.
Due to short timelines, applicants who do not need a new visa to visit China
will be preferred. 

Go to [our application form](https://tac-apply.apache.org) and apply as soon
as possible. The deadline for applications is July 6th 2023.

#### Community Over Code NA 2023
Applications are now being accepted to attend Community Over Code, North
America 2023, which is taking place in Halifax, Canada between the 7th and
10th October 2023.

Event details can be found [on communityovercode.org](https://communityovercode.org/)

The ASF Travel Assistance Committee hopes to offer around 20 Conference Passes 
along with Hotel and Travel assistance as needed. Assistance is open to 
anyone involved in Open Source including ASF Committers, non-committer 
contributors and people from open source projects in general.

Places are limited and will be awarded to those that are deemed most in need 
of assistance. Applicants from the Americas will be preferred, but we will
consider people from other continents who can provide a suitable reason
for attending this instead of their more local events.

We will attempt to help anyone needing a Canadian visa to apply for one, but
visa backlogs in many countries may mean it isn't possible to get a visa in 
time. For anyone who requires a visa and doesn't already hold a valid one,
we will immediately help you with the documents to apply, but won't book
travel until your visa is issued. Unfortunately we are unable to help
expedite visa applications or issuing.

Go to [our application form](https://tac-apply.apache.org) and apply as soon
as possible. The deadline for applications is July 22nd 2023.
