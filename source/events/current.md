          <p> The ASF Travel Assistance Committee hopes to offer 5 or 6 Conference Passes along with Hotel and Travel assistance 
              as needed. Assistance is open to anyone involved in Open Source including ASF Committers, non-committer contributors
              and people from open source projects in general.<p>
          <p> Places are limited and will be awarded to those that are deemed most in need of assistance. Applicants will need to
              already have a Visa or live in an EU Schengen Country that does not therefore require a Visa. No applications from 
              outside the EU will be concidered for this event.<p>
        <p> Go to <a href='https://tac-apply.apache.org'>our application form</a> and apply as soon as possible. The deadline for 
            applications is April 15th 2023.</p>
